# summation_calculator
Simple project which sums function inputs over a range of values.

Verbose:
As part of an effort to study calculus and apply some rudamentary coding principles, 
I will create a summation calculator. Summations are an intermediate mathematical 
concept where a function is iterated over a range of x values and these iterations 
are added together. For example, if f(x) = x^2 and I wanted to add together x inputs 
from a range of 1 through 5, the calculator will process 
f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + f(5).
The challenge is there are a few optimizations which allow special cases of functions
to be summed much quicker, such as with specific powers. My hope is to include
checks which will snap to simplified rules rather than raw processing output. This
will speed up processing time for more robust summations.

Goal 1: sum basic functions to the first power over user-defined ranges
Goal 2: sum lower power functions over user defined ranges
Goal 3: check to see if range applies to special cases, then use special cases
instead
Goal 4: include Riemann summs calculations
Goal 5: print full work on user request to allow user to follow along
Goal 6: graphical additions
Goal 7: code for a desktop/mobile OS and establish as a fully-fledged program

Feedback is intensely appreciated! I am a very new CS student at this present
moment but I hope to "git" good :)
